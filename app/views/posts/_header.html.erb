		I started my spiritual journey working as a project manager for my teacher and mentor Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, the founder of Trancedental Meditation around 30 years ago. Worked very closely on the TM Movement for around 18 years. Learned, experienced, researched and practiced different forms of meditation, yoga, astrology and ayurveda. Through the years, I researched and developed more focused and customized ways of tackling spiritual problems. I have used my knowledge to help people in India solve their problems by providing spiritual consultancy for more than 17 years. Now, I am embarking on another journey to reach out and help the people around the World find peace, tranquility, bliss and their purpose in life.
